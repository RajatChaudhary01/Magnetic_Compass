This app will give me geo direction (North, east,west,south,north east,north west,south east,south west) as well as latitude longitude of the same point .This will act as a server. Now in other client app, i have same app but it is receiving signal from server app so that it can synchronize itself with respect to the server app and when both app are in same direction it will show "align"

## How I built it

I built this app in android studio , it is my first project , it is the combination of software and hardware components. I made two apps as server and client . 

Challenges I ran into

Hardware concepts , mathematical equations of solving distance between two app, used BBC micro:bit for the first time.
